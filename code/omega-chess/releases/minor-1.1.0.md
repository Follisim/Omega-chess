# Omega Chess Minor Release 1.1.0


Over the past two weeks, our team has been working diligently to bring exciting new features and improvements to Omega Chess. Here are some of the key functionalities added in this release:

- The Kriegspiel Game Mode now has a new AI: **Darkboard**! This AI is a lot more challenging than the previous one, and it will be a worthy opponent for most players. Oh, it's the current Kriegspiel champion, by the way.
- Improved user interface with a sleek and intuitive design.
- Added the ability to register and login to the WebApp. Soon, you will be able to save your games and play with your friends!

We are thrilled to present these new additions and believe they will greatly enhance your enjoyment of Omega Chess. We hope you have a fantastic time exploring the latest version!
