# Omega Chess Alpha 0.1.0

Welcome to the first alpha of Omega Chess!

## What's this?

This is the first alpha release of Omega Chess. It contains a primordial version of the [Kriegspiel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegspiel_(chess)>) Game Mode, which is the first game mode to be implemented in Omega Chess.

## What's new

-   This WebApp itself is now available at [omega-chess.ddns.net](https://omega-chess.ddns.net/).
-   The WebApp is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means it can be installed on your device.
-   The Kriegspiel Game Mode is now playable.
-   A telegram bot is now available to play Kriegspiel games [@OmegaChessBot](https://t.me/OmegaChessBot).

## Notes

Both the bot and the game mode are still in alpha, so expect bugs and missing features.
